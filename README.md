# GradeCalculator
Simple Grade Calculator that I made to calculate my final grades in my classes before they were released for this semester. 

Clone of https://rogerhub.com/final-grade-calculator/ all credit goes to the creator, I just wanted to make my own version of this to practice making a UI.

To Run, open run the Jar file.
Java should be installed when trying to run the program.
